    "- However, Keras by default works only with Python, and so we'll be using an R package, [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/), to communicate with Python to use Keras in R via Python. So Python here acts as a bridge between R and Keras. For Python to work properly with Keras it needs to have necessary packages installed which will be done through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). The [R wrapper for Keras](https://keras.rstudio.com/) will be used in R.\n",
