# Machine Learning (and Deep Learning) in just over 200 minutes with R

This workshop is designed to help applied statisticians and biometricians enter the world of machine learning and deep learning. It is assumed that participants use the R statistical computing software for other tasks in the world of statistics. No prior machine learning knowledge is needed, but it assumed that participants are statisticians.
 
The workshop practical material is created by [Ajay Hemanth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajayhemanth/?originalSubdomain=au) and lectures are by [Yoni Nazarathy](https://yoninazarathy.com/). Participants are encouraged to try and execute R code on their own machine using the Jupyter notebooks provided here.
 
The practical material uses the Keras deep learning framework and to use it with R it is recommended to install Anaconda. A video detailing installation is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgEGyfSJFYw). Following the instructions in this video may take some time, hence it is recommended that participants do this prior to the start of the workshop. 

Note that the [installation instructions](Setup.md) are focused on Windows machines. Mac and Linux users may need to make minor adaptations. Participants should not hesitate to contact the course team prior to the workshop if installation help is needed.

Here are the [workshop slides](https://yoninazarathy.com/talks/ML225MinutesWithR.pdf).
